All the required dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file if you wish to use pip or conda to install dependencies


The environment.yml file in the environment file used by me. If you wish to use a conda environment you can utilize the same environemnt by using the command given below. The exported environment file is not cross-platform and will not work on a Windows system since it was created using a Linux system.

=) haven't tested this command, please check if it works
conda env create -f environment.yml
